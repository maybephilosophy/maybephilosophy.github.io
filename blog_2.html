  <h1>Materialistic vs Non Materialistic </h1>
  <p>The difference between materialistic and non-materialistic things is very important for my own
    philosophy. The basic difference between them is that materialistic things can be brought
    from money (free if you are good at bargaining) and no amount of money can buy non materialistic
     things. </p>

  <p>When the Lord Krishna died and Noah decided to change things, humans entered in the Dark Age.
    I will write another blog on the Dark Age too, so lets not go too deep into it. Humans in this era
     are full of insecurities and and do handful of sins which is very disturbing for all of us. This
     causes a permanent anxiety in every human being alive. </p>


  <p>Now back to materialistic and non-materialistic things. Loss of a materialistic thing does not hurt as
     bad as losing a non materialistic thing. Non materialistic things mainly include love, affection and
      knowledge. People at the starting of the era lost many of their non materialistic things and
       experienced the deepest level of sadness and along with that permanent anxiety, this sadness
        became unbearable and people started staying away from non materialistic things. This is why
         nowadays people put their careers before love and are mainly focused on making more and more
          money. I am not saying that this is wrong because this is what is supposed to happen, right?</p>



  <p>This also gave rise to "non loving" relationships and meaningless sex. Nowadays, these
    things are being considered cool, but I think is an attempt to overcome the thought that we
    humans are incapable of "True Love." I think that we will never get to experience or even see
     true love in this era. It is the hardest thing to do. In fact, gaining all the knowledge in this
     world would be easier than truly loving someone.  </p>


    <p> Thank you </p>
