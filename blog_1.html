  <h1>Introduction to the blog </h1>

  <p>I am a teenager who is very unsure about life (not saying I am suicidal). I am unsure about a lot of things in this world too and the title of my blogging site also suggests the same.
    There a lot of major stuff going on with humans and no one talks about it. Everyone knows that these things are happening, and when discussed openly some get offended, some laugh, just crazy. </p>

  <p>I am neither an "expert" in Philosophy nor I have read any books about Philosophy (I hope that I will get to read them in the future). But I know how to do basic thinking which according
    to my "Philosophy" is all it takes to become a "Philosopher." I really like finding the reason behind all these things that people don't talk about and somethings about which people actively talk about. By the way, I like to relate a lot of these things
with god, so I don't think that atheists will like this blog. </p>

<p>I belong to the country where English isn't the first language, so these blogs will not be well furnished in terms of language. I am into mathematics, physics and music.</p>

<p>I am not very well versed in HTML programming, so this website is not very good looking and without much features like comments, I believe it will get better with time. </p>

<p> Thank you </p>
